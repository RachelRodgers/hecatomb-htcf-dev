Running these scripts in this order will check if any of the reads assigned to BACTERIA during
Step 9 of the contaminant_removal.sh (bbsplit) inadvertently assigned some potential VIRAL reads
to BACTERIA

The scripts should be run from your base directory (same location that the contaminant_removal.sh script was run).

1) split_bacteria_cluster_counts.sh
2) split_bacteria_seqtable_merge.R
3) split_bacteria_search.sh

Results will be located in ./QC/step_9/check_bacterial/results
