Description: Scripts used to clean, cluster and assign taxonomy to
reads generatged using a RdAB-Virome protocol from a Viral-Like Particle
(VLP) preperation.

        - Additional helper scripts can be found in ../accessory

# All scripts should be launched from the base data directory containing
all demultiplexed *.fastq.gz (R1 & R2) that you wish to analyze.

# RUN ORDER:

	1) contaminant_removal.sh: removes contaminating and low-quality sequences
	2) cluster_count.sh: creates sequence count tables
	3) seqtable_merge.R: merges sequence count tables
	4) mmseqs_pviral_aa.sh: translated search against UniProt viral protein database -> annotates probable viral translated reads
	5) mmseqs_pviral_aa_check.sh: translated search of probable viral reads against UniProtKB database -> annotates likely viral translated reads
	6) mmseqs_pviral_nt.sh: untranslated search against NCBI viral genome database -> annotates probable viral untranslated reads
	7) mmseqs_pviral_nt_check.sh: untranslated search against NCBI bacteria + viral genome database -> annotate likely viral untranslated regions
	8) concatenate_results.sh: concatenates translated and untranslated annotations in viral and phage results tables
